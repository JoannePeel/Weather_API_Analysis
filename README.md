# Weather_API_Analysis
This is a python script which randomly generates coordinates for 500 + cities. The geographic information is then used to retrieve data via API from http://api.openweathermap.org. 

The information analyzed here was temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and maximum windspeed. The projected data correspond to the 9th of february 2019.


To run the complete script you will have to create a config file containing your personal api key which you can get for free [http://api.openweathermap.org].
